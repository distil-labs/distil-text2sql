Generate the SQL query that answers the question.\n\nInput:\n- Schema: One or two table definitions in SQL DDL format\n- Question: Natural language question about the data\n\nOutput:\n- A single SQL query that answers the question\n- No explanations, comments, or additional text\n\nRules:\n- Use only tables and columns from the provided schema\n- Use uppercase SQL keywords (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc.)\n- Use SQLite-compatible syntax",
    "input_description": "Each input consists of a database schema and a natural language question.\n\nSchema format:\n- One or two CREATE TABLE statements in SQL DDL format\n- Tables use lowercase snake_case names (e.g., customers, order_items)\n- Columns use lowercase snake_case (e.g., first_name, created_at)\n- Primary key column named 'id' with INTEGER PRIMARY KEY\n- Foreign keys named as {table_singular}_id (e.g., customer_id)\n- Data types: INTEGER, TEXT, REAL, DATE, DATETIME, BOOLEAN\n- 4-10 columns per table with constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, REFERENCES)\n- Two-table schemas include foreign key relationships\n\nQuestion types:\n- Counting: \"How many...\"\n- Aggregation: \"What is the average/sum/max/min...\"\n- Filtering: \"Which... where...\", \"List all... that...\"\n- Ranking: \"What are the top 5...\"\n- Joining: Questions requiring data from two tables\n- Grouping: \"...for each...\", \"...by category...\"\n\nDomains: e-commerce, HR/business, education, healthcare, finance, social/content",
    "llm_as_a_judge_instructions": "Evaluate whether the predicted SQL query correctly answers the question given the schema, using the reference query as ground truth.\n\nThe prediction is good if ALL of the following are true:\n1. Valid SQL - Query is syntactically correct and parseable\n2. Schema Compliance - All tables and columns exist in the provided schema\n3. Semantic Equivalence - Query returns the same result set as the reference (differences in aliases, formatting, or logically equivalent expressions are acceptable)\n4. Completeness - Query fully answers the question with no missing clauses\n\nThe prediction is bad if ANY of the above checks fail."
